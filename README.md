**Project Title: Used Car Price Prediction Model (Minor)**


This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting used car prices. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset, the following methodology was employed:

•	Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: The dataset was meticulously cleaned, and handled missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Categorical variables were transformed into numerical representations, and feature scaling was applied as necessary.

•	Feature Engineering: Key features influencing car prices were identified and engineered, including calculating car age for enhanced predictive power.

•	Model Selection and Training: Various regression models were explored, with the optimal model selected based on performance metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

•	Evaluation: The model's predictive capabilities were rigorously assessed using a testing dataset, and results were visualized for comprehensive analysis.

The developed model demonstrates promising performance in predicting used car prices and can serve as a valuable tool for industry stakeholders.
